    <p> In the seventh grade, I wanted to be a talk show host called "Hoprah." Now, I'm a journalism major and nonprofit leadership and social innovation minor at the University of Maryland. Although I no longer want to be a talk show host, my passion for storytelling has only grown. I have experience in writing, reporting and copy editing, as well as advocacy and leadership experience.  </p>
