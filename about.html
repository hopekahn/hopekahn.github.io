     <h1> A timeline of Hope Kahn in the media industry </h1>

     <h3> August 2013 - May 2015 </h3>
        <p> At just age 12, Hope decided her dream job was to be a talk show host and coined the nickname Hoprah. She spent her middle school mornings hosting the announcements and her afternoons in theater practice. She dreamed of studying Mass Communications in college. </p>

    <h3> August 2016 - May 2017 </h3>
        <p> A few years go by and Hope is a sophomore in high school. She excitedly signed up to take her school's journalism class and enters as a staff writer. She spent the year learning the structure of articles, how to interview and the basics of InDesign. This was when Hope decided journalsim was what she wanted to pursue and no longer wanted to be a talk show host.  </p>
