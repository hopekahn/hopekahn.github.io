           <h2>August 2013 - May 2015</h2>
           <p>At just age 12, Hope decided her dream job was to be a talk show host and coined the nickname Hoprah. She spent her middle school mornings hosting the announcements and her afternoons in theater practice. She dreamed of studying Mass Communications in college.</p>

           <h2>August 2016 - May 2017</h2>
           <p>A few years go by and Hope is a sophomore in high school. She excitedly signed up to take her school's journalism class and enters as a staff writer. She spent the year learning the structure of articles, how to interview and the basics of InDesign. This was when Hope decided journalsim was what she wanted to pursue and no longer wanted to be a talk show host.</p>

           <h2>May 2017 - August 2018</h2>
           <ul>
               <li> Hope was promoted to editor-in-chief at the very end of her sophomore year in May 2017. She spent the summer reading as much from the Baltimore Sun and New York Times as possible. </li>
               <li> During the first week of school, Wilde Lake teacher Laura Wallen was announced missing and later murdered. Hope and her Paw Print team knew they needed to use their platform to remember her.  </li>
               <li> After months of writing, editing and staring at InDesign, Hope finally held the completed newspaper in her hand. The center fold was dedicated to Ms. Wallen. </li>
               <li> Hope's passion for journalism continued to grow during her junior year. Near May 2018, she applied for a board position for jGirls. However, she didn't get it. But this rejection launched her into a new opportunity. </li>

           <h2>Senior year of high school (2018-2019):</h2>
           <ul>
               <li> Hope felt more confident than ever in her editor-in-chief position. She dreamed of attending the University of Maryland to study journalism at Philip Merrill. (Seriously, she only applied to three schools) </li>
               <li> Hope joined the 200 students working on the Since Parkland project. In total, she wrote and contributed to over 30 profiles on children and teenagers who lost their lives to gun violence in the year following the Parkland shooting. Read Hope's work on this project <a href="https://sinceparkland.org/authors/hope-kahn/" target="_blank"> here</a>.  </li>
               <li> Because of her work on Since Parkland, Hope started hearing about more freelance opportunities for high school journalists. She wrote her first ever paid piece for <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2019/02/28/seetals-seva-feminism-service/"target="_blank"> Ms. Magazine. </a> </li>
               <li> For Hope's research project, she extensively looked at the freedom of the press in high schools and the censorship of high school journalists. She presented her findings at the John's Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. </li>
               <li> Hope graduated high school in May 2019 excited to attend UMD in the fall.
